# Ecology and sexual conflict drive the macroevolutionary dynamics of inter-sexual mimicry and female-limited colour polymorphisms

Willink B, Ho TAT, and Svensson EI

We investigated the evolutionary history of female-limited colour polymorphisms and inter-sexual mimicry in pond damselfies (Odonata:Coenagrionidae).
Using a Bayesian Phylogenetic Mixed Models (BPMM) and a Hidden State Speciation and Extinction (HiSSE) model we found that:

  - Female colour polymorphisms are more likely to evolve when population densities at breeding sites are high, and that these demographic conditions are more common at high latitudes and in open landscapes.
  - Female-limited polymorphisms typically evolve from sexually dimorphic ancestors through the addition of a male-like female morph, consistent with the hypothesis of selection for male mimicry.
  - Female colour polymorphisms tend to increase both speciation and extinction rates, leading to higher evolutionary turnover of polymorphic lineages.
